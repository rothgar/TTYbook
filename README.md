# TTYbook
The TTYbook is a script that can turn your Linux laptop/desktop into a full text based productivity suite.

The bootstrap script will change your system runlevel 4 (typically unused) into a custom runlevel that can be used for times you don't want or need a GUI environment but want more than runlevel 3 with basic multi user functionallity.

TTYbook will install the following software if you don't already have it installed.

 * [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/)
 * [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)
 * [links](http://links.twibright.com/features.php)
 * [tmuxinator](https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator)
 * [weechat](http://weechat.org/)

TTYbook uses your standard user and configurations (dotfiles) so it doesn't break your current workflow or keyboard shortcuts.
